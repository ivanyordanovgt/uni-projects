Dear Professor, here you can see all my projects in my studying in Plovdiv University. I have a lot of personal projects that are unfortunetly private because I will be monetizing them. I would love to show them and talk about them tho! They include:

some of my projects are on youtube. Check them out.

1. API for CS:GO with over 4000 items with up to date information. (images, descriptions, current prices).
2. PylaAI - currently my focus when I have time, trying to make a company that will 
sell bots. Currently have a bot for chess.com/lichess and LoL (League of Legends).
3. AI Trainer - simple app with Tkinter that uses yolov8 framework to train the model while the Tkinter app itself 
lets you click on images to annotate objects in them.
And other smaller ones.

Thank you for reading, have a nice day.
